# Kata

[Spanish version](kata-es.md)

CodeX Academy expects its students to participate in Kata throughout their individual journeys to practice coding skills and solidify logical thinking and problem solving skills. In each level starting with Full-Stack Developer Apprentice 1, you will find a requirement to advance in kata training. We use [CodeWars](https://codewars.com){:target="\_blank"} as a kata training platform. If you're just getting started, you should create an account and take the platform tutorials.

## Requirements

Each pathway/level in CodeX Academy will have a corresponding CodeWars Rank requirement. The badge listed in the pathway will carry the rank title in its name (ex: "CodeWars Rank 6kyu"). NOTE: The numbers in the rank titles go down as the rank goes up.

| Pathway Level                     | CodeWars Rank |

| Full-Stack Developer Apprentice 1 | 8kyu          |
