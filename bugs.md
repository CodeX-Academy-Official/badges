## Bugs and Issues

If you find anything AT ALL that needs repair or improvement, we hope you will take the time to report it. This will help this library constantly evolve and improve. As a bug-finder you have a couple options:

1) Report the bug only

or

2) Report and fix the bug

### Reporting the Bug

1. Head over to the ["Issues" page](https://github.com/CodeX-Academy-Official/badges/issues) for this repository
2. Start a "New Issue"
3. In the title, give a quick summary of what's wrong (something better than "It doesn't work", of course).
4. In the description, please help a bug-fixer understand the steps they should perform to reproduce your bug. If possible, a link to the page you're talking about would be genious!
5. Save the issue (and consider [fixing it yourself](contributing.html) if you can)
