## Contributing to This Library
If you'd like to contribute to CodeX Academy's library of micro-certifications, you can do so by following the steps below.

In advance, thanks for taking the time to help us constantly improve this library!

### Follow These Steps
1. Submit an issue in Github that describes the problem and need for an update (ex: Badge X needs an update to X resource)
2. Fork this repository to your personal Github account.
3. Make changes to the `md` files to update resources, exercises, or competencies.
4. Commit those changes to your local/personal repo.
5. In your repo in Github, create a pull request. Be sure to describe the changes and why they were needed. Also, to connect your pull request to your issue from step 1, include a "tag" with the number of the issue (ex This fixes issue #5534).
6. Submit the pull request and someone at CodeX Academy will review and (hopefully) merge the changes.
