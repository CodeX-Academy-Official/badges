## PLEASE NOTE:

The online course and certification exam are free of charge. ScrumStudy, of course, would like to gain you as a customer. They are a great company and, if you want to earn more certifications, we encourage you to do so. HOWEVER, becoming a paying customer and/or earning more certifications from ScrumStudy is not a part of the requirements for this or any other badge in the CodeX Academy pathways. Please be aware that ScrumStudy might attempt to "sell" you on their other services. It is 100% acceptible to politely decline and focus on the SFC certification.
