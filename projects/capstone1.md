# Front-End Developer Level 1 Capstone Project

Complete a simple project and deploy to a publicly accessible website.

## Project

Combine the knowledge from previous badges and deploy a functional "Professional/Personal Website" to a public web server (ex: [professional resume/CV](https://www.cakeresume.com/Github-resume-samples?locale=en), [portfolio](https://hashnode.com/post/30-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-cknfx6wdg069kxws1bjjv8mhw), [personal site](https://mockitt.wondershare.com/web-design/personal-website-design.html), etc). The website must properly implement/utilize skills required in the badges contained in the same level (i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc). 

NOTE: This project should NOT contain code from a template or boilerplate of any kind.
