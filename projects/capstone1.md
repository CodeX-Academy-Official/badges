# Front-End Developer Level 1 Capstone Project

Complete a simple project and deploy to a publicly accessible website.

## Project

Combine the knowledge from previous badges and deploy a functional browser application to Heroku. Web application must properly implement/utilize skills required in the badges contained in the same level.

## Ideas/Suggestions

If you need help thinking about what to build, you could check out [this list of ideas](https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/){:target="_blank"}.

Other project ideas are:

* Survey form: Create a survey with different types of fields and validate them before submiting the survey. [Example](https://codepen.io/SitePoint/full/akPoad){:target="_blank"}

* Quiz: Develop a quiz game with different questions and their possible answers. It should have it's own scoring system, a home page and a final screen. [Example](https://codepen.io/SitePoint/full/GmPjjL){:target="_blank"}

* Pomodoro Clock: Develop a [pomodoro clock](https://todoist.com/es/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique){:target="_blank"}. The user should be able to set a timer with any number of minutes, which represents the focus session. Once the focus session is done, the clock should ring and start a break session. The break session should be 5 minutes.

* Hangman game: Develop a hangman game where the player should guess a random word to save a person. It should have a variaty of possible words and choose one randomly. Also it needs a countdown that resets whenever the user selects a correct letter. [Example](https://goodatcode.github.io/javascripthangman/){:target="_blank"}
